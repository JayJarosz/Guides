### Manveer's Annotated :zap:Thundroid:zap: Guide
--------

I've been telling myself for over a year that I'll set up a Bitcoin node, but I would always procrastinate. That's until I saw Stadicus' article on Medium: ["The perfect Bitcoin ⚡Lightning⚡ node"](https://medium.com/@stadicus/perfect-low-cost-%EF%B8%8Flightning%EF%B8%8F-node-4c2f42a4ff7b). The photo of his Thundroid was oddly tantalizing, and the next thing I knew I was ordering an Odroid from South Korea. 

While Stadicus' guide was a great starting point, 

* I quickly ran into issues not mentioned in the guide that had me stumpted for a while. 
* I found myself wanting more explanations for the commands we were running.
* I wanted to skip the testnet and jump right into the mainnet.
* I became tired of jumping between the [Thundroid guide](https://medium.com/@stadicus/perfect-low-cost-%EF%B8%8Flightning%EF%B8%8F-node-4c2f42a4ff7b) and the [RaspiBolt guide](https://github.com/Stadicus/guides/tree/master/raspibolt) to get the full(er) picture.
* I wanted to install Bitcoin's blockchain directly from my node (my laptop doesn't have enough space).
* I wanted to make tweaks to Stadicus' customizations (especially in Bash).
* I wanted to jump into bonus stuff like Tor and a web interface.

So with that in mind, I created my own guide. At first it was private and for my own use. I used it kind of like a journal of sorts to try to better understand what I was doing in Stadicus' guide, to document issues I ran into (and the solutions that worked), and to keep track of the tweaks I made. I later realized that this could be useful for other newbies to see, so I polished it up a bit and made it public.
